### Hi there, I'm Beck

#### About Me

- Maker of software
- Lover of tech and automation
- Amateur neovim enthusiast

#### Iâ€™m currently learning

- How to setup microservices in a way that's somewhat sane

#### I'm currently trying (and failing) to learn

- Kubernetes (fourth time's the charm, eh?)
- Rust (I have no meme cred yet and it's embarrassing)

#### Fun fact

I force push on personal repos way more than I probably should
